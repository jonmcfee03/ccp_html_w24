            <p>Bangkok, Thailand's capital, is a large city known for ornate shrines and vibrant
                street life. It is officially known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon and

                take long to realize why. Bangkok is a city of contrasts with action at every turn.

                take a longtail boat through floating markets. Food is another Bangkok highlight,
                from local dishes served at humble street stalls to haute cuisine at romantic
                rooftop restaurants.</p>
